      <p class = "blurb">Coding is usually seen as something Computer Science majors do, <strong>but that's not always the case!</strong> Coding can be used to do so many things like <i>drawing, creating video games, data analysis, making websites, automating tedious actions, and so so much more</i>. The Interdisciplinary Coders at West Valley is here to teach you all the ways that coding can be used -- which both can be used within your career or even for personal development.</p>
